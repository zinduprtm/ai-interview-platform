/**
 * Evidence quotes arrive from the portfolio generator already wrapped in
 * quotation marks — PRD-01 §5 shows the model's expected output as
 * `"\"I split the context into...\""`, and the stored JSONB matches. Rendering
 * those values inside another pair of quotes produced `""I put together …""`,
 * which made the most defensible part of a report look malformed.
 *
 * Normalising here rather than at write time keeps existing rows readable
 * without a data migration, and tolerates a generator that stops adding quotes
 * later. The straight pair, both curly pairs, and the typographic single pair
 * are all recognised, because the model has produced each of them.
